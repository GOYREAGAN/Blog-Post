             <h2>Starting Point and the Quest for the Right Tools</h2>
             <p>
                Greetings👋,I am Goy Reagan, an aspiring Chemical Engineer/Computer Scientist/Computer Engineer.<br>
                You must be wondering what the hell is wrong with me, well I like explorering and learning<br>
                anything that I find interesting and sparks my curiousity, basically am the real definition of;<br>
                <strong>"Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than master of one"</strong>
             </p>
             <p>
                I am currently learning JavaScript for Web Development and am interested in <br>
                learning Python for scripting later on in my coding journey if time allows.<br>
                Today, I woke up bored and decided to code a blog post about my development environment<br>
                and also provide a learning resource I use to learn coding. <em>My development environment is tentative</em>
